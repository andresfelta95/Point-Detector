    Description: This program will be used to play the dart game.
            This program will have the following states:
                - NoGame:       The game is not being played, Keep asking to the server for a new game
                                This state will finish when the server sends a new game 
                - ClearBoard:   Check until the reading of all the sensors is more than 35 cm

                - GameDart1:    Gets the location of the first dart, and sends it to the server
                                After 20 if the dart is not in the board sends false to the server
                - GameDart2:    Gets the location of the second dart, and sends it to the server
                                After 20 if the dart is not in the board sends false to the server
                - GameDart3:    Gets the location of the third dart, and sends it to the server
                                After 20 if the dart is not in the board sends false to the server

                - NextTurn:     Will ask the server for if a new turn is available, if it is, then it will
                                move to the ClearBoard state, if not, then it will move to the NoGame state


            The sensors are connected to the Multiplexer as follows:
               - Sensor 1: Channel 0
               - Sensor 2: Channel 1
               - Sensor 3: Channel 2
               - Sensor 4: Channel 3
               - Sensor 5: Channel 4
               - Sensor 6: Channel 5
               - Sensor 7: Channel 6
               - Sensor 8: Channel 7
               - Sensor 9: Channel 8
               - Sensor 10: Channel 9
            The ESP32 is connected to the Multiplexer as follows:
               - S0: Pin 18 (past 4) 
               - S1: Pin 5 
               - S2: Pin 17 (past 18)
               - S3: Pin 16 (past 19)
               - E: Pin 19 (past 23)
#              The echo pin of the sensors is connected to the ESP32 as follows:
#              - Sensor 1: Pin 13 (past 32)
#              - Sensor 2: Pin 12 (past 33)
#              - Sensor 3: Pin 14 (past 25)
#              - Sensor 4: Pin 27 (past 26)
#              - Sensor 5: Pin 26 (past 27)
#              - Sensor 6: Pin 25 (past 14)
#              - Sensor 7: Pin 33 (past 12)
#              - Sensor 8: Pin 32 (past 13)
#              - Sensor 9: Pin 35
#              - Sensor 10: Pin 34
#              The trigger pin for the multiplexer is connected to the ESP32 as follows:
#              - Pin 4 (past 15)
